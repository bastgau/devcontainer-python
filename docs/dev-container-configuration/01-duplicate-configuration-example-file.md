######  **◀️ Previous step: [Introduction](./00-configure-new-project.md)**

# Duplicate configuration example file

Before you begin, you need to rename the file named *'devcontainer.json-example'* located in the *'.devcontainer/'* directory to *'devcontainer.json'*.

The new tree should look like :

```
.devcontainer/
├── Dockerfile
├── devcontainer.json
├── install-deps.sh
├── ...
└── install.sh
````

Now we will mainly modify this file.
